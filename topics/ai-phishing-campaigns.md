# AI-Powered Phishing Campaigns

## Overview
This repo explores how artificial intelligence is being used to create highly personalized and dangerous phishing attacks. By scraping data from social media and past breaches, AI tools can write emails that sound exactly like your coworkers or boss. Making them harder to detect than ever before.

## How It Works
- **Data Gathering**: AI tools scrape public info from LinkedIn, Facebook, data leaks, etc.
- **Message Creation**: Tools like WormGPT and FraudGPT generate realistic emails that mimic tone, grammar, and context.
- **Fake Pages**: AI can also build fake login sites that look just like Microsoft 365 or payroll portals.

## Real-World Example
An employee receives an email from what looks like their CFO, asking for an urgent wire transfer. The message sounds legit and even references a recent meeting. It’s AI-generated and fake—but the money is already gone.

## Defense Solutions
- Use phishing-resistant MFA (like hardware keys or phone app prompts).
- Deploy email filters that detect unusual writing styles.
- Train users with realistic simulations of AI-generated phishing attempts.

## Why This Matters
Phishing attacks have increased over 4,000% since AI tools became public. Businesses and individuals must adapt quickly to stay safe in this new threat landscape.
